About
-----

The Carbon Diet is a web application designed to facilitate accurate social
carbon footprinting. The master version of the site is at http://www.carbondiet.org,
but you are free to install your own copies elsewhere, as long as:

1) You leave the "powered by" notice in the footer intact.
2) You leave the existing content in the "help/about" section. You may add your
   own, but please leave the existing stuff intact.
3) You rebrand the site so it does not look the same as http://www.carbondiet.org.

You can change the source code, but you must make the modified source code
available to users of your modified site. See the license section below for
details. If you do change the code, please inform the developers through github
so we can integrate your improvements!
