Hi,

You asked us to remind you if you hadn't put any data in the Carbon
Diet for a while! Well, it's been a while now, so why not log on 
and enter some more data? Perhaps take a meter reading, or tell us 
what fuel you've purchased recently.

Go to: http://www.carbondiet.org/users/<%=@user.login%>/accounts

Remember, the calculations are more accurate if you put data in 
regularly!

To stop these emails, go to http://www.carbondiet.org/user/edit

Thanks!
